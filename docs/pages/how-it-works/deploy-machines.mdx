In DevSpace, machines are the infrastructure that run your devcontainer. Providers like GCP, AWS, and DigitalOcean are considered "machine" providers because they first set up a virtual machine (VM) to host your container.
 
When you start a workspace with DevSpace, such as running `devspace up`, DevSpace uses a selected provider and starts your devcontainer. 
If the provider requires a virtual machine (VM), DevSpace determines whether to create one. It uses your local environment's credentials and the corresponding CLI tool (e.g., `aws` for AWS or `az` for Azure) to set up the VM. 
Once the VM is running, DevSpace connects to it through the provider's secure tunnel. Below are examples of providers and their secure tunnels.

- AWS: [Instance Connect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-connect-set-up.html)
- Google Cloud (GCP): [Cloud IAP (Identity-Aware Proxy)](https://cloud.google.com/security/products/iap)
- Azure: [Azure Bastion](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bastion/bastion-overview)

:::note
Alternatively, you can use [SSH tunneling](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/tunneling-example) to connect to your machines, if supported by your setup.
::: 

The dedvpod agent starts a SSH server using the STDIO of the secure tunnel in order for you local DevSpace CLI/UI to forward ports over the SSH connection. Once this is done DevSpace starts your local 
IDE and connects it to the devcontainer via SSH.
