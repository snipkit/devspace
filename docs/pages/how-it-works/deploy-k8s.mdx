DevSpace works the same with kubernetes as with Machines, the key difference is the secure tunnel is set up using the kubernetes control plane (e.g. kubectl ...) so an agent is not necessary
to be run on the kubernetes node. Instead devspace-provider-kubernetes simply wraps the appropriate `kubectl` commands to start and connect a workspace using a devcontainer.

DevSpace often has to build workspaces even when an "image" is specified in .devcontainer.json. This is because the devcontainer can contain "features" the cause the Dockerfile to be extended.
When this happens, or simply when "build" is used in .devcontainer.json, DevSpace deploys an init container to the workspace that uses kaniko to first build your image (see #tutorials/reduce-build-times
for more details on kaniko) then executes the container's entrypoint in the pod's main container. While building, if REGISTRY_CACHE has been specified in the context options, kaniko will download
existing build layers from the registry to reduce the overall build time.
