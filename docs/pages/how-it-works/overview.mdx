Devspace provides the ability to provision workspaces on any infrastructure. It does so by wrapping your conventional CLI tools such as kubectl, docker, gcloud etc to deploy your development environment 
and set up everything required to run the dev container. While creating the workspace DevSpace deploys an agent to the machine running the container as well as to the container itself to provide useful 
functions such as port forwarding, credential forwarding and log streaming. Doing so it provides a control plane across your development environment.

Devspace uses a client-agent architecture, where the client deploys it's own agent to host various servers, such as a grpc server or SSH server. 
In this regard the system is not unlike a browser server architecture where the front end is deployed and executed on a remote host. There are several improvements this brings to our specific context:
 - There can be no conflict of versions between client and server, since you install only one version of the client
 - There is no infrastructure to manage for users
 
To simplify debugging, DevSpace connects your local shell with the agent's STDIO so you can see what's happening locally and in the container at all times.

Below is a high level overview of how DevSpace uses your local environment, a source repo and a devcontainer to deploy your workspace to the cloud.

Devspace establishes a connection to the workspace using a vendor specific API. This vendor specific communication channel is referred to as the "tunnel".  When you run a `devspace up` command, DevSpace selects a 
provider based on your context and starts your devcontainer. If using a machine provider, DevSpace will check if it should create a VM first. Once the devcontainer
is running DevSpace deploys an agent to the container. The way in which DevSpace communicates with the workspace depends on the provider, this is known as the "tunnel". For AWS this could be instance connect, kubernetes uses
the kubernetes control plane (kubectl), this connection is secured based on this tunnel. The DevSpace agent starts a SSH server using the STDIO of the secure tunnel in order for you local DevSpace CLI/UI to forward
ports over the SSH connection. Once this is done DevSpace starts your local IDE and connects it to the devcontainer via SSH.

If you developer environment requires any port forwarding, then your IDE or an SSH connection must be running. That's because devspace needs the SSH server running on the agent to perform the forwarding,
which is deployed when starting the IDE or SSH session.
