## Create a machine

You can create a new machine using:

```sh
devspace machine create <name-of-machine> --provider <provider-name>
```

At any point you can list all the machines using:

```sh
devspace machine list
```

An example output would be:

```
  NAME | PROVIDER | AGE
-------+----------+------
  <name-of-machine> | aws      | 21s
```

You can check in which state is a machine using:

```sh
devspace machine status <name-of-machine>
```

Example output:

```
08:48:58 info Machine '<name-of-machine>' is 'Running'
```

## SSH into a machine

It is possible to SSH directly into the provider's machine using

```sh
devspace machine ssh <name-of-machine>
```

This will open a full ssh session to the machine.

## Stop a machine

Stopping a machine is as easy as:

```sh
devspace machine stop <name-of-machine>
```

You can check the status afterwards using:

```sh
devspace machine status <name-of-machine>
```

Example output:

```
08:58:58 info Machine '<name-of-machine>' is 'Stopped, you can start it via 'devspace machine start <name-of-machine>''
```

## Delete a machine

Finally, you can delete the machine simply using:

```sh
devspace machine delete <name-of-machine>
```
