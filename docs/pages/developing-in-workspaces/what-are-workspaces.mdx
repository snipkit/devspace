A workspace in DevSpace is a containerized development environment, that holds the source code of a project as well as the dependencies to work on that project, such as a compiler and debugger.
The underlying environment where the container runs will be created and managed through a DevSpace provider. This allows DevSpace to provide a consistent development experience no matter where the container is actually running, which can be a remote machine in a public cloud, localhost or even a Kubernetes cluster.

To configure the development container, DevSpace reuses the [devcontainer.json](https://containers.dev/) specification, which is also used by other popular tools, such as [VS Code dev containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) or [Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces).
This means you can already reuse projects that use this configuration to spin up a workspace in DevSpace. If no configuration is found, DevSpace will automatically try to find out what programming language is used and provide an appropriate template.

A workspace in DevSpace can be stopped and restarted without losing its state. This allows you to install additional programs or change configuration without the need to reconfigure the container.
Depending on the Provider, DevSpace will also automatically determine when a workspace is currently not be used and shutdown any unused resources to save costs.
